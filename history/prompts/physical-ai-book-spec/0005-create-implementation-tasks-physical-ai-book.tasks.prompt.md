## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

The implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book have been created at specs/1-physical-ai-book-spec/tasks.md, detailing phased development by module and chapter, including setup, content drafting, code examples, and pedagogical elements.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Detailed implementation tasks for book development generated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 1 file created: specs/1-physical-ai-book-spec/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: User to review tasks and begin implementation or further refinement.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated a comprehensive, dependency-ordered task list based on the specification and architectural plan, aligning with Docusaurus structure.
